Note About HTML Links
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The HTML version of this lesson contains links pointing to various HTML
   documents provided with the Toolkit. All of these links are relative
   and, in order to function, require this document to be in a certain
   location in the Toolkit HTML documentation directory tree.
 
   In order for the links to be resolved, if not done already by installing
   the lessons package under the Toolkit's ``doc/html'' directory, create a
   subdirectory called ``lessons'' under the ``doc/html'' directory of the
   ``mice/'' tree and copy this document to that subdirectory before
   loading it into a Web browser.
 
 
Environment Set-up
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Use of Mice from MATLAB requires the Mice source and library directories
   exist in the MATLAB search path. MATLAB provides a programmatic command
   to add directories to the search path, "addpath."
 
 
Unix/Linux
 
   Assume Mice is installed at /naif/mice/. The corresponding path to the
   Mice library being /naif/mice/lib; the path to the Mice source files
   being /naif/mice/src/mice.
 
      >> addpath( '/naif/mice/lib')
      >> addpath( '/naif/mice/src/mice')
 
 
Windows
 
   Assume Mice is installed at C:\naif\mice\. The corresponding path to the
   Mice library being C:\naif\mice\lib; the path to the Mice source files
   being C:\naif\mice\src\mice.
 
      >> addpath( 'C:\naif\mice\lib')
      >> addpath( 'C:\naif\mice\src\mice')
 
 
Confirm MATLAB can access Mice:
 
      >> which mice
 
   A proper response shows a path to the Mice interface library, similar
   to:
 
      /naif/mice/lib/mice.mexmaci
 
   The response
 
      'mice' not found.
 
   indicates the MATLAB search path does not include the Mice directories
   ``src/mice'' and ``lib.''
 
 
A simple example program
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This script calls the Mice function 'cspice_tkvrsn' then outputs the
   return value.
 
   File tk_ver.m:
 
      function tk_ver()
 
         disp( ['Toolkit version : ' cspice_tkvrsn('TOOLKIT') ] )
 
   From MATLAB, execute the function:
 
      >> tk_ver
      Toolkit version : CSPICE_N0061
