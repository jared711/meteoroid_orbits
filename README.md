# MODA
### Meteor Orbit Determination Application
MODA is a MATLAB application and accompanying library that was designed to allow meteor scientists to quickly and accurately determine the orbital elements of an observed meteoroid. It allows the user to input data in multiple formats and see the effects of various perturbations including third-body effects, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure (SRP), and Earth oblateness effects (J2).
